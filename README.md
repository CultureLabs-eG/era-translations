## What is ERA?

> ERA is a space in which individual stories of people having resisted against the terror, humiliation and despair fascism brought over Europe are kept alive and visible for everybody.

It is an online video archive which currently offers video interviews with [21 actvists](http://www.resistance-archive.org/en/testimonies/) from [resistance movements in different countries](http://www.resistance-archive.org/en/resistance), who actively fought against Nazi-Germany in the Second World War.

The initial version of ERA was launched in 2007. [Several groups and organizations](http://www.resistance-archive.org/en/about/what-is-era/) across six european countries helped to collect materials and conducted the video interviews.

## What Languages?

The language of the interviews is always the witnessâ€™ mother language, which compiles to the following list of â€žERA languagesâ€œ:

	- French
	- German
	- Italian
	- Polish
	- Slovenian

In oder to make the content as accessible as possible for a wider audience, all ERA interviews had been transcribed and translated in to English.

## What is this repository?

Due to the tight project budget, it was not possible to translate the contents into all â€žERA languagesâ€œ.

With the release of a technologically updated version of ERA in 2016 the idea to [crowd-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) the missing translations came up.

This repository on [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is the central point to manage and organize the volunteers who want to contribute to the translation progress.

## What about you?
