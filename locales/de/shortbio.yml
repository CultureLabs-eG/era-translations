    shortbio: Romana Verdel (geborene Rotter) wurde 1938 in Remschenig/Remcenik im
      zweisprachigen Teil von Kärnten/Koroska geboren. Ihre Familie gehört der slowenischen
      Minderheit an. Zusammen mit ihrer Mutter Anna Rotter und weiteren Verwandten
      wohnt sie bei Katarina Sluga, ihrer politisch engagierten Tante und Mitgründerin
      des Antifaschistischen Frauenbundes. Der NS-kritischen Haltung und der politischen
      Vernetzungstätigkeiten verdächtig, schließen sich einige Familienmitglieder
      1943 den slowenischen PartisanInnen an. Der Rest der Familie wird im Oktober
      1943 von der Gestapo arretiert und deportiert. Romana bleibt von der Gestapo
      unentdeckt und wird zusammen mit anderen Kindern von ihrer Tante Amalija versteckt,
      bis diese sich im Januar ’44 mit den Kindern den PartisanInnen in den Bergen
      und in Solcava im Logartal anschließt. Im April ’44 kehrt Amalija mit den Kindern
      nach Kärnten/Koroska zurück, wo Romana auf einem Bauernhof aufgenommen wird
      und den Krieg überlebt, während 13 ihrer Familienangehörigen als PartisanInnen
      fallen bzw. im KZ umgebracht werden. Die verwaiste Romana bleibt nach Kriegsende
      als Magd am Bauernhof und zieht später auf den Hof ihrer Eltern in Remschenig/Remcenik.
      Zwanzig Jahre leidet sie an Anämie. Im Laufe der Zeit normalisiert sich ihr
      Leben, doch »Wenn ein Kind den Krieg durchmacht, auch Glück hat, dass es überlebt
      – die Angst bleibt im ganzen Leben.«
