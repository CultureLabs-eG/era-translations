# The resistance movement in Austria

From the beginning of the German occupation in March 1938 up to the liberation in May 1945, no unified resistance in Austria was established. No organisation became a common association of the many different resistance groups. The most important reason lies in the fact that the Austrian population did not see or realize the occupation to be »foreign«.

Thus, the resistance remained fragmented according to the different party policies and the different social, political and cultural environments. From the beginning on resistance groups were repeatedly weakened through flight, arrest or death. Within the »left«, socialist resistance groups existed on an all-German scale for a while. The resistance of the communists was defined to be »Austrian-patriotic« and was directed against the Hitler-German foreign rule. On the »right«, confessional and monarchist resistance groups developed from summer/autumn 1938 on. Later on, these groups were in touch with the Allied secret services. Besides, resistance existed in the concentration camps and there were many forms of individual acts of resistance. It is important to note that those being racially persecuted or being Jewish received little help.

Of all the groups involved in armed combat, the movement of the Slovene partisans in Carinthia was the most important. It developed alongside the liberation struggle in Slovenia and of the entire Yugoslav people.

  On March 12th, 1938 Austria was occupied by German troops. The Austro-fascist regime, having ruled since 1933/34, did not put up military resistance. Apart from the foreign occupation, the Austrian provinces, too, were taken over by an »inner seizure of power« through the Austrian National Socialists. Many did not acknowledge the new regime as a foreign rule.
